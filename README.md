# CFB Season Simulator

To run, use
```
python3 src/main.py --iterations 10000
```

This will simulate the rest of the Big 12 regular season and display some nice graphs and tables. It will also store images of those graphs in the results directory.

The first time you run this each day, the current status of the season will be scraped from the Massey Ratings website.
